For this project, I wrote unit tests for a Graph ADT, then implemented a SparseGraph using an
incidencelist to handle sparse data efficiently. I also implemented Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find
the shortest paths in a real street map of Baltimore. I tested my solution with a small campus
map and larger street datasets, and used runtime and memory profilers to measure performance.
This homework helped me understand how to design graph structures, apply shortest-path algorithms,
and debug and evaluate real-world pathfinding problems.
