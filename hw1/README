For this project, I implemented Flappy Box, a simplified Flappy Bird-style game in Java using object-oriented principles.
I completed and tested key game mechanics such as jumping, falling, collision detection, and scoring, and organized the
game using multiple classes like FlappyBox, Pipe, and Game. I also ensured the game complied with style guidelines, ran
smoothly with accurate collision logic, and ended appropriately based on game events. This project helped reinforce my
understanding of class design, inheritance, and dynamic behavior in Java.
